This repo is dedicated to the game of sticks. In sticks you have two players and a heap of sticks on a board. Each player takes a turn picking up 1, 2, or 3 sticks. The person who picks up the final stick is the loser. 

The code is split into pieces.
First, I have implemented the game as a two-player game.
Next, I will add an AI that one player can play against.
After that, I will add the ability for one AI to play against another AI.
